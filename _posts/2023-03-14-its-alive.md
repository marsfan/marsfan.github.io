I finally got around to creating my own website. It will probably look like a
mess for a while, as I have very little Web Development experience.
Additionally, there will probably be a large and sudden influx of blog posts
while as I get some musings that I have written down over the years to the
site. After that, update will be sporadic.

The site itself is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and then uses
a custom GitHub Action to deploy it to GitHub Pages. I originally tried using
Hugo, but found the documentation lacking, so I switched over to Jekyll.

Using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages means that I don't have to worry about
learning how to set up a server. I get some free hosting and continuous
integration as long as the website's source is public. You can see the source
[here](https://github.com/marsfan/marsfan.github.io).
